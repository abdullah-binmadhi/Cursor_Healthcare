## Usage Examples

### Basic Query
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect('healthcare_analytics.db')

# Get patient count by gender
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT gender, COUNT(*) as count 
    FROM patients 
    GROUP BY gender
""", conn)

print(df)
```

### Complex Analytics
```python
# Average length of stay by medical condition and admission type
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT d.diagnosis_description,
           a.admission_type,
           AVG(a.length_of_stay) as avg_los,
           COUNT(*) as admission_count
    FROM admissions a
    JOIN diagnoses d ON a.admission_id = d.admission_id
    WHERE a.length_of_stay IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY d.diagnosis_description, a.admission_type
    ORDER BY avg_los DESC
""", conn)

### Using Views
```python
# Get current patient census
df_census = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM current_census", conn)

# Get top diagnoses
df_diagnoses = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM top_diagnoses LIMIT 10", conn)

# Get physician performance
df_physicians = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT * FROM physician_performance 
    WHERE total_cases > 10 
    ORDER BY avg_satisfaction DESC
""", conn)
```

### Running Analytics Queries
```bash
# Run all analytics queries
python run_analytics_queries.py

# List available queries
python run_analytics_queries.py --list

# Run specific query (e.g., query #3)
python run_analytics_queries.py 3
```

## Data Quality

The script includes data cleaning and validation:
- Handles missing values appropriately
- Converts data types (dates, numbers)
- Creates unique patient IDs
- Estimates missing fields (birth dates, financial breakdowns)
- Validates data constraints

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes are created on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key relationships are properly established
- Data types are optimized for SQLite
- Batch inserts are used for better performance

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sample data for readmissions, quality metrics, and vital signs
- Implement data visualization dashboards
- Add more complex analytics queries
- Create data export functionality
- Add data validation and quality checks
