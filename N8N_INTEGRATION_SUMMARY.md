# n8n Webhook Integration for Healthcare Website - Summary

## Overview

Your healthcare website is now equipped with a complete n8n webhook integration that automatically sends events to your n8n instance when users interact with the platform. This enables powerful workflow automation based on user behavior.

## Integration Status

✅ **Integration Successfully Installed**
- Webhook script: `/healthcare-website/scripts/n8n_webhook_integration.js`
- Script referenced in: `/healthcare-website/index.html`
- Test page available: `/healthcare-website/n8n_test.html`

## How It Works

The integration automatically captures 4 key types of user interactions:

### 1. Patient Search Events
- Triggered when users filter doctors by specialty or hospital
- Sends search parameters and anonymous user ID

### 2. Cost Estimate Events
- Triggered when users calculate healthcare costs
- Sends patient information and procedure details

### 3. Doctor Rating Events
- Triggered when users view doctor ratings
- Sends doctor information and rating data

### 4. Analytics View Events
- Triggered when users access the analytics dashboard
- Sends dashboard access information

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure n8n Webhook
1. Log in to your n8n instance
2. Create a new workflow
3. Add an "HTTP Request" trigger node
4. Copy the generated webhook URL

### 2. Update Healthcare Website Configuration
1. Open `/healthcare-website/scripts/n8n_webhook_integration.js`
2. Update the `WEBHOOK_URL` with your n8n webhook URL:
   ```javascript
   const N8N_CONFIG = {
     WEBHOOK_URL: "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/YOUR-WEBHOOK-ID",
     AUTH_TOKEN: "",  // Optional authentication
     TIMEOUT: 5000
   };
   ```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Open `/healthcare-website/n8n_test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test Connection" to verify the webhook works
3. Check your n8n instance for received events

## Example n8n Workflows

### User Activity Tracking
```
HTTP Webhook → Set → Google Sheets (Append)
```
Track all user interactions in a Google Sheet.

### Cost Estimate Notifications
```
HTTP Webhook → Switch (cost_estimate) → Email (Send estimate summary)
```
Send email notifications with cost estimates to users.

### Popular Search Analysis
```
HTTP Webhook → Filter (patient_search) → Function (Aggregate) → Database (Store)
```
Analyze popular doctor/hospital searches to improve recommendations.

## Privacy & Security

- Uses anonymous user identifiers (no personal health information)
- All data transmission over HTTPS
- Configurable authentication token support
- Complies with healthcare data privacy best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection failed**: Verify webhook URL is correct
2. **Authentication error**: Check AUTH_TOKEN configuration
3. **CORS error**: Configure n8n to allow requests from your domain
4. **Timeout error**: Increase TIMEOUT value

### Debugging
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify network requests in developer tools
3. Check n8n execution logs
4. Test webhook URL directly with curl
